# Code-As-Math

This is a reference to ease methematics-aficiandos into [typed, pure functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming).
More specifically we will use the [elm programming language](https://elm-lang.org) as it is simple and [fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elm_(programming_language)) for the purpose.

## Motivation

Telling a computer what to do need not be imperative and therefore branch out
from mathematics and logic. On the contrary, code can abstract the kind of
details that make it imperative and therefore can profit from the great body of
knowledge the domains of logic and mathematics contain.

From here on the use of *code* will refer to [purely functional code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming). This is
to make it obvious that what is said to be true about *code* only applies to
this subset of programming languages. This is opposed to languages that do not
strive to *look* like logic, but rather like a list of instructions. Without
delving into detail it is enough to distinguish between these two categories to
make useful statements about them in relation to mathematics and logic.

For a guide aimed at explaining mathematics and logic in an imperative language see
